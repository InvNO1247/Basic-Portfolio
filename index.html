             I currently supervise a granite company in Winter Haven FL.  Our shop relies on alph cam and auto cad programs to function the CNC saw so I took it upon myself to learn these programs and it has sparked something in me to do more.

            I am hoping to use my new skills get our company out of the dark ages and grow our business.

            Most trade companies are very old school and are getting left in the dust by the new technologies, I aim to prevent that for us.
